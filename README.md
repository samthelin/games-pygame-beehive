# games-pygames-beehive
A repository for the game BeeHive developed with pygames. This game is a computer predecessor to the mobile game BeeHive developed in Pythonista. 

This was an experiment to prepare for the mobile game with the same name. The code is very primitive in places, written without custom-made classes. This has been fixed in the mobile version, which has a more efficient implementation.
